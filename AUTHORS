  "All rights to the code I've written will pass over to Jari-Matti Mäkelä,
  in case I catch the bus or the bus catches me.
  My death will probably not be made known anywhere on the internet,
  therefore my testament will become effective if I don't
  show any signs of life for 6 months on the internet.
  Within this time limit I may always revoke or edit this testament,
  by committing to the hg repository at http://hg.sharesource.org/dil/
  Only the latest revision of this file is to be considered valid."
