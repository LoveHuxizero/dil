  Testament:
  "In the event of my death I wish that all the rights to the source code
  I have written shall pass over to the public domain.
  My death will most probably not be announced anywhere on the internet,
  therefore my testament will become effective if I don't
  show any signs of life for 6 months on the internet (i.e.
  commits to the repository, e-Mails, IRC etc.)
  Within this time limit I may always revoke or edit this testament,
  by committing to the git repository at http://github.com/azizk/dil/.
  Only the latest revision of this file is to be considered valid."
