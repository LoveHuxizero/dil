Description
===========
This software is a command line utility, a compiler written in D 1.0
for the D programming language (1.0 and 2.0).

How To Compile dil
==================
In order to compile dil you need to have:
 *) DMD 1.037 (http://www.digitalmars.com/d/1.0/changelog.html)
 *) Tango 0.99.7 (http://dsource.org/projects/tango/)
 *) DSSS 0.77 (http://dsource.org/projects/dsss/)
    or alternatively:
    Python 2.5 and scripts/build.py

If you can't compile dil because you have a newer version of these programs
then report the problem to me, please (see Bugs section.)

Regarding Tango on Windows:
There is a regression in the Path class of Tango. You'll have to wait for
the next version, or try to compile with a previous version.

Regarding DSSS:
You have to make sure that the correct config file is used.
A default can be set in dsss/etc/rebuild/default.
Use dmd-posix-tango, dmd-win-tango, gdc-posix-tango or gdc-win-tango.

Compile dil:
# Change to the directory where you extracted dil.
$ cd dil/
# Type "dsss build".
$ dsss build
# The executable of dil is put into the bin/ directory.
$ ls bin/
# Output> dilconf.d  dil
# Run like this:
# On Linux:
$ bin/dil
# On Windows:
> bin\dil.exe

Compile with Python:
# Print help.
$ scripts/build.py -h
# Compile a release binary.
$ scripts/build.py
# Compile a debug binary.
$ scripts/build.py --debug

# On Windows you probably have to call python explicitly.
> python scripts\build.py

Executing dil without parameters will print the main help message.

The language of the compiler messages can be set in the configuration file.
Many messages are still untranslated. This task has low priority at the moment.
