Description
===========
This software is a compiler written in D 1.0 for the D programming language.

How To Compile dil
==================
In order to compile dil you need to have:
 *) DMD 1.035 (http://www.digitalmars.com/d/1.0/changelog.html)
 *) Tango 0.99.7 (http://dsource.org/projects/tango/)
 *) DSSS 0.77 (http://dsource.org/projects/dsss/)

If you can't compile dil because you have a newer version of these programs
then report the problem to me, please (see Bugs section.)

Regarding DSSS:
You have to make sure that the correct config file is used.
A default can be set in dsss/etc/rebuild/default.
Use dmd-posix-tango, dmd-win-tango, gdc-posix-tango or gdc-win-tango.

# Change to the directory where you extracted dil.
$ cd dil/
# Type "dsss build".
$ dsss build
# The executable of dil is put into the bin/ directory.
$ ls bin/
# Output> dilconf.d  dil
# Run like this:
# On Linux:
$ bin/dil
# On Windows:
> bin\dil.exe

You should see the main help message printed in the console.

The language of the compiler messages can be set in the configuration file.
