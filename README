==Description==
This software is a command line utility, a compiler written in D 1.0
for the D programming languages, version 1.0 and 2.0.

==How To Compile DIL==
In order to compile DIL you must have:
 *) DMD 1.063 (http://www.digitalmars.com/d/1.0/changelog.html)
 *) Tango 0.99.9 (http://dsource.org/projects/tango/)
 *) MPFR 2.4.2 (http://mpfr.org)
 *) Python 2.6.5 (2.5 might work too)
    (DSSS ist unmaintained and can't compile DIL anymore.)

If you can't compile DIL because you have newer versions of these programs
then report the problem to me, please (see Bugs section.)
I hope you won't find it frustrating to successfully compile this software,
and apologize if you do.

Regarding MPFR:
Windows users have to use Visual C/C++ or Cygwin in order to compile
the MPFR library for their system. Precompiled libraries are available here:

  http://holoborodko.com/pavel/downloads/win32_gmp_mpfr.zip

I have not tested compiling a Windows binary yet. DIL should compile
if you put one of the debug or release mpfr.lib files into a path
where the linker can find them. E.g.: pass the following to build.py:
  > python scripts\build.py -- -L+mpfr.lib -L+C:\downloads\mpfr\Win32\Release\


==Compile DIL with Python==
# Note: The binary is placed in the bin/ folder.

# Change to the root directory of DIL. E.g.:
  $ cd git/dil/
# Print help.
  $ scripts/build.py -h
# Compile a release binary.
  $ scripts/build.py
# Compile a debug binary.
  $ scripts/build.py --debug
# Pass additional parameters to the compiler like this:
  $ scripts/build.py -- -unittest

# On Windows you probably have to call python explicitly.
  > python scripts\build.py

# Run like this:
# On Linux:
  $ bin/dil
# On Windows:
  > bin\dil.exe

Executing DIL without parameters will print the main help message.

The language of the compiler messages can be set in the configuration file.
Many messages are still untranslated. This task has low priority at the moment.
