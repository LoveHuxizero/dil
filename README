Description
===========
This software is a compiler written in D 1.0 for the D programming language.

How To Compile dil
==================
In order to compile dil you need to have:
 *) DMD 1.033 (http://www.digitalmars.com/d/1.0/changelog.html)
 *) Tango 0.99.7 (http://dsource.org/projects/tango/)
 *) DSSS 0.75 (http://dsource.org/projects/dsss/)

If you can't compile dil because you have a newer version of these programs
then report the problem to me please (see Bugs section.)

Regarding DSSS 0.75:
On Posix systems a correction in dsss/etc/rebuild/dmd-posix-tango is
required. In the "[link]" section, remove "-L-lphobos" from the cmd option
in order to avoid symbol conflicts.

Before you run dil, make sure that the executable can find config.d and
lang_en.d (which are located in "<dil>/src/".)
The language of the compiler messages can be configured in config.d.
(Please, note that many messages are still untranslated.)
