Description
===========
This software is a command line utility, a compiler written in D 1.0
for the D programming language (1.0 and 2.0).

How To Compile Dil
==================
In order to compile dil you must have:
 *) DMD 1.056 (http://www.digitalmars.com/d/1.0/changelog.html)
 *) Tango 0.99.9 (http://dsource.org/projects/tango/)
 *) MPFR 2.4.1 (http://mpfr.org)
 *) DSSS 0.77 (http://dsource.org/projects/dsss/)
    or alternatively:
    Python 2.6.4 (2.5 might work too) and scripts/build.py

If you can't compile dil because you have a newer version of these programs
then report the problem to me, please (see Bugs section.)
I hope you won't find it frustrating to successfully compile this software,
and apologize if you do.

Regarding DSSS:
You have to make sure that the correct config file is used.
A default can be set in "dsss/etc/rebuild/default".
Use dmd-posix-tango, dmd-win-tango, gdc-posix-tango or gdc-win-tango.

Note: DSSS can't compile dil anymore (due to some source files in Tango).
Please use build.py instead. I'm sorry if that doesn't work also.

Regarding MPFR:
Windows users have to use Visual C/C++ or Cygwin in order to compile
the MPFR library for their system. Precompiled libraries are available here:
http://holoborodko.com/pavel/downloads/win32_gmp_mpfr.zip

I have not tested compiling a Windows binary yet. Dil should compile
if you put one of the debug or release mpfr.lib files into a path
where the linker can find them. E.g.: pass the following to build.py:
  > python scripts\build.py -- -L+C:\downloads\mpfr\Win32\Release\


Compile dil:
# Change to the directory where you extracted dil.
  $ cd dil/
# Type "dsss build".
  $ dsss build
# The executable of dil is put into the bin/ directory.
  $ ls bin/
# Output> dilconf.d  dil
# Run like this:
# On Linux:
  $ bin/dil
# On Windows:
  > bin\dil.exe

Compile with Python:
# Print help.
  $ scripts/build.py -h
# Compile a release binary.
  $ scripts/build.py
# Compile a debug binary.
  $ scripts/build.py --debug

# On Windows you probably have to call python explicitly.
  > python scripts\build.py

Executing dil without parameters will print the main help message.

The language of the compiler messages can be set in the configuration file.
Many messages are still untranslated. This task has low priority at the moment.
